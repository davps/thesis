# This is my thesis

This is an experiment. I'm hoping that by making my work on my thesis public,
my time will become more accountable by the fact that anyone will be able to
see when I am or am not working. 

I also believe that all academic research should be made more open. This is a
small step towards such a philosophy. (Making my code itself available would
be better again, but one step at a time.)
