\section{Adressing and routing}

The process of determining systematically how to forward 
messages toward the destination node based on its 
address is called routing. \cite{PetersonDavie:2003}

Adressing types: 

	\subsection{Unicast}
	The source node wants to send a message to a single destination node.
	
	\subsection{Broadcast}
	The source node want to \emph{broadcast} a message to all the 
	nodes on the network.
	
	\subsection{Multicast}
	The source node send a message to some subset of the 
	other nodes, but not all of them.
